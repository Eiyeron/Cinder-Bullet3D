This is a very simple made to order block that easily gets you up and running with the Bullet Physics library and Cinder.

Working platform only supports iOS and MacOSX for Cinder 0.8.5. (note: simulator not built for debug, if using simulator you need to switch your scheme to release, debug working on all device and macosx)

TODO: msw working platform as well.

One included sample just shows Hello World program from http://www.bulletphysics.org/mediawiki-1.5.8/index.php/Hello_World

You can find out more about bullet at http://bulletphysics.org/wordpress/

Warning: Dev Branch using new cinder, which won't work with cinder 0.8.5.
