This is a very simple made to order block that makes it easy to include Bullet Physics library with Cinder.

Working platform only supports iOS for Cinder 0.8.5

TODO: make macosx and msw working platforms as well.

One included sample just shows Hello World program from http://www.bulletphysics.org/mediawiki-1.5.8/index.php/Hello_World
